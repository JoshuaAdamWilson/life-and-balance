        per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include
        orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit
        card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address.
        In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt
        to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone
        number provided at the time the order was made.
